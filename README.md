# Python_fractals
Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. I am using Python turtle module to accomplish few of the simple fractals. Various simple fractals includes
  + The Sierpinski Triangle
  + The Plant System
  + The Gosper Curve
