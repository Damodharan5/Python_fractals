#Gosper Curve

The Gosper curve, also known as Peano-Gosper Curve,[1] named after Bill Gosper, is a space filling curve. The Gosper curve can be represented using an L-System with rules as follows:

  +   A -> A-B--B+A++AA+B-
  +   B -> +A-BB--B-A++A+B

where A and B means move forward and '+' and '-' means turn right and left respectively. The angle here is 60°.
